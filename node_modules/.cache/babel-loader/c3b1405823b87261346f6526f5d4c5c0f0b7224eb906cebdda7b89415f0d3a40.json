What started as a humble initiative has today grown into a recognized institution for children with special needs in Gadag.\r\n\r\nThe school is currently training 42 children, while more than 120 parents seek counselling and guidance from the team. Over the years, Arunodaya has trained 183 children, with 29 successfully integrated into mainstream schools. Among them, one proud student went on to complete a postgraduate degree in Social Work — a milestone that reflects the school’s vision and impact.\r\n\r\nArunodaya strongly believes in holistic development. Children here are nurtured not only through academics but also through arts, physical education, medical support, and specialized therapies. The focus is on empowering each child to achieve independence, confidence, and dignity in life.\r\n\r\nThe school is equally committed to supporting families by providing counselling, awareness programs, and guidance to parents of special children. This two-way approach strengthens both the child’s and the family’s journey.\r\n\r\nOver time, Arunodaya has built a strong reputation for its social service and inclusive education model. With the continued support of well-wishers, community members, and organizations like Seva Bharati and Seva UK, the school remains steadfast in its mission — to provide every child with special needs a nurturing, inclusive, and hopeful future.</div>\r\n        <hr className=\"school-hr\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br></br> */}\r\n\r\n      {/* Slider + Stats + Timeline */}\r\n      <div className=\"slider-section\">\r\n        \r\n        <StatsSection />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage2;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,iBAAiB;AACxB,OAAOC,WAAW,MAAM,eAAe;AACvC,OAAOC,YAAY,MAAM,gBAAgB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAE1C,SAASC,SAASA,CAAA,EAAG;EACnB,oBACED,OAAA;IAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAkB;IAAAC,QAAA,eAkD/BH,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAC,QAAA,eAE7BH,OAAA,CAACF,YAAY;QAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACb;EAAC;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEV;AAACC,EAAA,GA1DQP,SAAS;AA4DlB,eAAeA,SAAS;AAAC,IAAAO,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
